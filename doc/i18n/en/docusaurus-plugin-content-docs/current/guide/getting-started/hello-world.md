# Hello World
The objective of this chapter is to write a first program in Althread: the traditional "Hello World".

## Creating the File
To begin, you will need to create a file `hello-world.alt` containing the following code:

```althread
main {
    print("Hello world");
}
```

- `main` is the name of the main process of your program. This is where the execution of your program begins.
- `print("Hello world")` is an instruction that displays the text "Hello world" in the console.
